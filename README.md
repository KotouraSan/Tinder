<h1 align="center">Hi there, I'm Firuziddin Najimov and  <a href="https://github.com/KotouraSan/Tinder" target="_blank">this is my Pet-Project "Tinder"</a> </h1>
<h3 align="center">Project is written on Java, using Microservices structure.</h3>
<h4 align="center"> Here is the backend code for CRUD operations with a PostgreSQL database. I used the Lombok library to simplify the code writing process. Additionally, I implemented caching with Redis and messaging with RabbitMQ, and everything is deployed using Docker. The application consists of two services that can be accessed via Postman at the addresses localhost:8080/api/person and localhost:8080/api/feed. The "/person" service is for creating, editing, deleting, and searching user accounts. The "/feed" service is for searching people from the "/person" service using data filters. Data is transmitted through HTTP requests using RestApi. You can filter people based on key data such as relationType, location, interest, and gender. </h4>
